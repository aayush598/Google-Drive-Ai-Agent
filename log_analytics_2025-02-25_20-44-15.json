    "summary": "The logs show a user interacting with a file management system.  Common patterns include fetching file permissions, viewing file lists, and fetching file content.  Anomalies include repeated calls to `/fetch-permissions` and  multiple instances of detecting the same email address in sensitive files. The system also returns HTML responses where JSON might be more appropriate for some endpoints.",
    "common_patterns": [
        "Fetching file permissions (/fetch-permissions)",
        "Viewing file lists (/view-permissions, /rename-files)",
        "Fetching file content (/fetch-content)",
        "Searching for files (/search)"
    ],
    "anomalies_detected": [
        "Repeated calls to /fetch-permissions within a short time frame.",
        "Multiple detections of email address 'aayushgid598@gmail.com' in sensitive files, indicating a potential data leak or privacy concern.",
        "Redundant or inconsistent file naming ('Completion_Cert.pdf.pdf', 'File_Report.pdf.pdf.pdf').",
        "HTML responses instead of JSON responses for certain endpoints, potentially hindering programmatic access."

    "recommendations": [
        "Investigate the repeated calls to /fetch-permissions to determine if there's a client-side issue or a need for caching.",
        "Implement stricter data sanitization and redaction to prevent sensitive information (like email addresses) from being exposed in logs and file contents.",
        "Introduce a mechanism to detect and prevent redundant file names and enforce a standardized naming convention.",
        "Refactor endpoints like /view-permissions and /rename-files to return JSON responses instead of HTML for better API consistency and programmatic usage.",
        "Add error handling and logging to the sensitive file detection system to provide more context on each detection."
